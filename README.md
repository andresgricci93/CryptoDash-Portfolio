### Server Mode (Self-hosted)

If you have your own ChromaDB server:

```bash
CHROMA_MODE=server
CHROMA_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Cloud Mode (ChromaDB Cloud)

If you use ChromaDB Cloud:

## 🎯 Available Scripts

### Backend

```bash
pnpm run dev          # Start development server with nodemon
pnpm start            # Start production server
```

### Frontend

```bash
pnpm run dev          # Start Vite development server
pnpm run build        # Build for production
pnpm run preview      # Preview production build
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 5000 or 5173 is already in use:

- **Backend**: Change `PORT` in `.env`
- **Frontend**: Vite will automatically suggest the next available port

### MongoDB Connection Error

Make sure:
- Your IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas (Network Access)
- Your connection string has the correct password
- There are no special characters in password (or they're URL encoded)

### Frontend Can't Connect to Backend

- Verify backend is running on port 5000
- Check `VITE_API_URL` in `frontend/.env` is correct
- Restart the frontend server after changing `.env`

---

## 🚢 Deployment

### Environment Variables for Production

Update these in your `.env` for production:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

### Recommended Platforms

- **Frontend**: Vercel, Netlify, Render
- **Backend**: Render, Railway, Heroku
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (already cloud-based)

### 🧠 Design Decisions & Future Improvements

One of the main challenges explored in this project is long-term conversational memory for AI systems.

Rather than storing entire conversations indefinitely, the design focuses on a multi-level memory approach:

- **Daily conversation summaries** to limit context size and cost
- **Weekly consolidated summaries** generated from daily summaries
- **Manually pinned notes** for critical or long-term information
- **Controlled forgetting**, allowing irrelevant details to expire over time

This approach aims to balance relevance, scalability and cost, mimicking how human memory works rather than accumulating raw chat history.

The full memory consolidation pipeline was intentionally not implemented in the MVP to keep the focus on core product value and avoid unnecessary complexity.

### 📰 Market News Ticker (Planned)

A horizontal news ticker is planned at the top of the dashboard, continuously scrolling key cryptocurrency headlines from right to left.

Key aspects:
- Real-time crypto market headlines
- Lightweight, non-intrusive UI similar to financial TV tickers
- Context-aware filtering based on tracked assets
- Designed to provide quick situational awareness without disrupting the main workflow

This approach prioritizes information density while keeping the interface clean and focused.
